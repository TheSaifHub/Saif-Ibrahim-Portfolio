> **"Turning raw data into actionable intelligence."**

## 📖 About The Project

This is my personal portfolio website designed to showcase my journey as a **Data Analyst** and **Aspiring Data Scientist**. It serves as a central hub for my technical projects, professional resume, skills, and content creation work.

The site is built with a **mobile-first** approach, ensuring it looks great on all devices, and hosts my contact forms using **Netlify's** serverless form handling.

### 🌟 Key Features
* **Responsive Design:** Fully adaptive UI for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile.
* **Dynamic Components:** Header and Footer are loaded dynamically using JavaScript to maintain clean code.
* **Netlify Forms:** Contact form integrated directly with Netlify (No PHP backend required).
* **Project Showcase:** Dedicated section for Data Science, ML, and SQL projects.
* **Interactive UI:** Smooth scrolling and animations using AOS (Animate On Scroll).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
* **Styling:** Bootstrap 5, Custom CSS
* **Icons:** Bootstrap Icons
* **Hosting:** Netlify
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Since this project uses JavaScript `fetch` to load the header/footer, you cannot simply open the `index.html` file. You must run a local server.

**Prerequisites:**
* You need **Python** installed (which, as a Data Scientist, you definitely have!).

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/TheSaifHub/Saif-Ibrahim-Portfolio.git](https://github.com/TheSaifHub/Saif-Ibrahim-Portfolio.git)
    cd portfolio
    ```

2.  **Start a Local Server (Python)**
    ```bash
    # If using Python 3
    python -m http.server
    ```

3.  **View in Browser**
    Open your browser and navigate to:
    `http://localhost:8000`
