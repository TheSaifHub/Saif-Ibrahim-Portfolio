## 📖 About The Project

This is my personal portfolio website designed to showcase my journey as a **Data Analyst** and **Aspiring Data Scientist**. It serves as a central hub for my technical projects, professional resume, skills, and content creation work.

The site is built with a **mobile-first** approach, ensuring it looks great on all devices, and hosts my contact forms using **Netlify's** serverless form handling.

### 🌟 Key Features
* **Responsive Design:** Fully adaptive UI for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile.
* **Dynamic Components:** Header and Footer are loaded dynamically using JavaScript to maintain clean code.
* **Netlify Forms:** Contact form integrated directly with Netlify (No PHP backend required).
* **Project Showcase:** Dedicated section for Data Science, ML, and SQL projects.
* **Interactive UI:** Smooth scrolling and animations using AOS (Animate On Scroll).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
* **Styling:** Bootstrap 5, Custom CSS
* **Icons:** Bootstrap Icons
* **Hosting:** Netlify
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Since this project uses JavaScript `fetch` to load the header/footer, you cannot simply open the `index.html` file. You must run a local server.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Since this project uses JavaScript to dynamically load the header and footer, you cannot simply open `index.html` by double-clicking it (browsers block local file requests for security). You must use a local server.

### Option 1: VS Code (Recommended)
1.  Open the project folder in **Visual Studio Code**.
2.  Install the **[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)** extension.
3.  Right-click on `index.html`.
4.  Select **"Open with Live Server"**.

### Option 2: Command Line (Python)
If you prefer the terminal and have Python installed, you can use it to launch a quick web server:

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/TheSaifHub/Saif-Ibrahim-Portfolio.git](https://github.com/TheSaifHub/Saif-Ibrahim-Portfolio.git)
    cd Saif-Ibrahim-Portfolio
    ```

2.  **Start the server**
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

3.  **View in Browser**
    Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000`
